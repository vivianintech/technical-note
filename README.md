# Technical-note Introduction

This is my technical note for problem solving some issues that I have come across throughout my day-to-day jobs.

I think this should be open to everyone because I love to share my experience and hopefully this can be helpful to you.

This contains:

- git-note: solutions for some frequently asked git questions
- <to-be-updated>
